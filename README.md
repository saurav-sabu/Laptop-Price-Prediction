## Introduction

As the laptop market continues to grow, predicting laptop prices becomes essential for both consumers and retailers. This project employs machine learning techniques to create a predictive model for estimating laptop prices based on various features. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about different laptops and their corresponding prices.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes details about various laptops, such as brand, specifications, ram, and prices etc. 

## Installation

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saurav-sabu/Laptop-Price-Prediction.git
cd Laptop-Price-Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
